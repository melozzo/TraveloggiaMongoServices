When you issue a docker build command, the current working directory is called the build context.
By default, the Dockerfile is assumed to be located here, but you can specify a different location with the file flag (-f). 
Regardless of where the Dockerfile actually lives, 
all recursive contents of files and directories in the current directory are sent to the Docker daemon as the build context.

to build docker image use -t is the switch to give it a name (sort of)

docker build -t traveloggia-node-api .
